            <h2>Background, Personality & Motivations</h2>
            
            <h3>Identity and Background</h3>
            <div class="info-grid">
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Basic Information</h4>
                    <p>Zaril Nanaz is one of the two main protagonists in <span class="highlight">Revival: Lost</span>, alongside his brother Liraz. Both brothers are <span class="highlight">60 years old</span> and have been separated since they were 10 due to their intense rivalry.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Education</h4>
                    <p>Zaril holds a <span class="highlight">PhD in Psychology</span> and has a <span class="highlight">psychology master's degree</span>, making him the intellectual "nerd brother" of the duo.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Separation</h3>
            <p>The brothers' rivalry was so intense they were "about to nuke the world to win." Responsible parents separated them for <span class="highlight">50 years</span>. They are eventually reunited by <span class="highlight">The Diabolic</span>, who uses their current trauma and places money around to bring them back together.</p>
            
            <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
            <p>Zaril is portrayed as the <span class="highlight">nerd brother</span>, the smart one of the two. He has an <span class="highlight">extensive vocabulary and knowledge</span> though he is slightly rigid. He uses his smarts to <span class="highlight">outmaneuver his brother Liraz at every opportunity</span> he gets. He also has experience in the <span class="highlight">sword and culinary arts</span>. He enjoys <span class="highlight">smiling over his defeated brother</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Zaril is portrayed as <span class="highlight">conspiring</span> and focused on farming wishes from the Genie to create "ludicrous stuff for violence." He's initially skeptical, stating he won't accept the Genie's existence until he has a "portable version of Neptune legally under his name."</p>
            
            <p>The Genie nicknames him <span class="highlight">"nerdillious Wierdo"</span>, which he objects to strongly, even challenging her to a duel over it. He enjoys conflict as a "perfect distraction for Liraz" and takes winning very seriously in competitions.</p>
            
            <h3>Core Motivation</h3>
            <p>Zaril's primary motivation is his <span class="highlight">rivalry with Liraz</span>. Their obsession with competing against each other is literally what keeps them alive in the haunted house. The game explores the theme: <span class="highlight">"What is the result of obsession?"</span></p>
            
            <p>If one brother dies, the other also dies because without the competition, they lose their reason to avoid the ghosts. They need <span class="highlight">competition, not cooperation</span>, to survive.</p>

            <p>In the "Bevrious" sequence, if Zaril and Liraz reach the Sinus section, they are dismembered and die. At the CANON end of the game, both brothers eventually join a <span class="highlight">multiversal anti-diabolic group</span>.</p>
            
            <h3>Media Presence</h3>
            <p>Zaril is featured in the game's main theme song, described as a rap battle between him and Liraz. He's also depicted on the potential box art in a sword fight with his brother. The game's creator, Zapped Zaid, hopes to voice act Zaril personally.</p>
